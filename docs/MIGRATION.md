# Migration Notes

## Removing personal information
You can use a tool like `ag` at the root to find all instances in the repository.
- All instances of my email, `spicyriceballs@protonmail.com` should be replaced.
- Instanced of `red-thread` and `red thread` should probably be replaced as well.

## Customizing
- `package.json` and `config/site.js` should be updated accordingly to match actual site details.
